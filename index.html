          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p class="intro">I'm a current math teacher with a passion for learning and solving problems. As an aspiring software developer,
             I want to show you who I am and showcase my humble abilities in the software realm. Software development
             presents countless opportunities to pursue my passions and I am ecstatic at the prospect
             of making it into my career.

            <h3>Problem-Solving</h3>
            <p>It can be difficult to show evidence of problem-solving, but as someone who started doing Sudoku puzzles in the 2nd grade,
                I believe it is one of my strengths. With a strong mathematical foundation, I enjoy finding the optimal ways to accomplish
                the task at hand.

            <h3>Communication and Teamwork</h3>

                teamwork. Working well with others and building off each others' strengths is vital to reaching the highest levels of success 
                in any realm.
